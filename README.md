# Getting started with ML and AI

This is a small list of resources I have fould over the past few years that have helped me get into Machine Learning and AI. This is primarly aimed at beginners, However, many of the resourecs have selections of more advance content definately applicable for more advance peolpe.

# What language should you learn?
There are SOOOOO many resources and for learing to code online. So much so it can become complicated even selecting a programming language to begin with.

Learing a programming language is a challange, but I will say, once you learn one, picking up others is MUCH easier. Many of the consepts to do with programmin are the same no matter what language you choose. It is more about how you decompose a problem into small, manageable chunks than anything else.

That said, some languages are easier to learn than others, and some languages are designed to be approachable to newcommers. One such language is [Python](www.python.org). Better yet, Google has developed an bunch of tools for ML/AI they call [TensorFlow](www.tensorflow.org). TensorFlow makes getting into ML/AI much easier than it was only a few years ago, yet is still powerful enough to be used by many organizations and researches for production ready application and state-of-the-art research.

# ML/AI Material to Sink Your Teeth Into
 MIT, Stanford University, Georga Tech and more host some great FREE material online as well as other independant researchers and hobiests.

## Resources for Getting Started
**TensorFlow Tutorials and Examples**: Here are some great resources for actual code examples you can download and tinker with yourself untill you're ready to code something from scratch.

- [Hvass-Labs](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials):  
- [LearningTensorFlow.com](http://learningtensorflow.com)
- [TensorFlow website](www.tensorflow.org)

**Acedemic Resources**: Coding examples and tutorials are great, there is not doubt about that. However, if you've been bitten by the ML/AI bug you may want to delve a bit deeper into the inner workings of the field. Luckily there are tonnes of resources online to satisfy your curiosity.

**SELF DRIVING CARS**: MIT, Stanford University, Georga Tech and more host some great FREE material online. The first 2 are specifically pitched at self driving cars and have some neural networks you can tinker with right in the browser.

## More advanced (but still approachable)

**Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Deep Reinforcement learing is right at the forefront of ML/AI research. I recently did a research project revolving DeepRL. These are some of the resources that got me started. I found just reading one of these gives a good base level understanding, but reading more definately help *reinforce* your understanding.
